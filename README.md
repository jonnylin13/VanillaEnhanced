# VanillaEnhanced

VanillaEnhanced is a Spigot 1.13.2 plugin that aims to improve vanilla Minecraft survival with game-friendly replacements to popular commands.

This is for my personal use, so anyone is welcome to fork or use themselves! I've designed it to be generic enough for re-use and distribution -- just be sure to release your own version under the MIT license.

## Feature list

* Permissions
* Retrievable spawners with silk touch
* Toggleable instant woodcutting
* Custom mobs, EXP, and level system

## Plans

* **Current plans:** RPG elements (upgrade health, chance to invis on crouch, chance for critical on crouch)
* Instant woodcutting becomes accessible w/ a craftable axe
* Teleport scrolls can be crafted and bound to a location or player's home, teleport on consume
* Wireless redstone transmitters/receivers

## How to use

You can clone this project and build it yourself, because I haven't posted it on Spigot, Curse, or Bukkit yet.

`git clone https://github.com/jonnylin13/VanillaEnhanced.git`

The project relies on `ProtocolLib`'s most recent build, `Spigot 1.13.2`, and `CraftBukkit 1.13.2`.
